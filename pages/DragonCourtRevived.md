## History
The original Dragon Court was released around 1997 as a Java Applet, but became abandonware around 2017. It was created by Fred Haslam who handled the bulk of the coding and design. Elden Bishop contributed to the code as well, with design help from Lawrence Wegner and Diane M. Jones. Ted Galaday produced the artwork.

The game relies on a dedicated server to handle saving player progress, mailing items between players, building clans, and maintaining leaderboard rankings. Since the original site no longer exists, the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150221225003/http://wild.fiends.com/DCourt/Game.stm) was used to salvage as much of the original information as possible.

Only the last known client version was found (v19b037) as a Java Applet. Unfortunately, Java Applets have been phased out by modern browsers since 2013, and became fully unsupported by 2015-2017. However, thanks to the CheerpJ technology, the original Dragon Court binary became runnable as WebAssembly and JavaScript in modern browsers without additional setup or tinkering. The last step was figuring out how to allow the functioning Dragon Court game client to save hero progress and other online related features with a custom server. Thus the team at Penguin Chilling Games began work on the **Dragon Court: Revived** project that we see today.
